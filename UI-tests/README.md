# Hygieiaâ„  UI Tests

This contains a Serenity based project for testing the Hygieia UI. It is important to ensure that changes made in the development process will not break existing functionality, and having a UI test suite can accomplish that. The foundation Serenity provides is a BDD mentality allowing the easy addition of use cases and meaningful reporting. It can also be easily integrated into the development pipeline; the reports are mounted as a volume to the UI Test service, allowing for viewing in tools such as Jenkins and GitLab CI.

The acceptance test suite included is based upon a Docker platform, completed by:
* Starting up containers needed for testing
* Inserting dummy data
* Running test suite
* Cleaning up containers

## Selenium Hub

The tests incorporate a set of images produced by Selenium, known as the Selenium Hub and Nodes. By using the Hub, one can use a Chrome node, Firefox node, etc to ensure that the application is tested fully. See this github page [here](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium) for more quality information.

**NOTE:** Data does not need to be removed since database container has no volumes. *The test data is deleted with the container.*

## Running the UI Tests (With Docker)

`mvn clean install -Puitests` for 'nix based operating systems.

`mvn clean install -Puitest-windows` for windows based operating systems.


If you need a different base image for your UI Tests, use the -Duitest.baseImage flag to specify the image name. The default image is maven:3.3.9-jdk-8-alpine.

**NOTE:** In order to run the UI tests with the included mechanism, **the machine running the tests needs to have a version of docker compatible with docker-compose**.

Included in the UI-test folder is a uitests.sh script. By changing the exported fields in this file, the script can be run on a nix based machine to run the UI tests in a dockerized manner. The included docker-compose file will create all the dependent images, run your set of acceptance tests, and finally the script will clean up all of the artifacts created during your suite. The only files that will be persisted in the process will be those that reside in your parent project - the test results will be modified in place in the UI-Test folder. *For running the UI tests as a maven build and not part of docker, see the section below.*


## Personalizing the uitests.sh file

In the case where your organization is using different images to test/deploy your instance of Hygieia, you may put your specific image tag in its corresponding spot in the uitests.sh script. This is helpful if you have an internal private registry, are working off of a locally built image, etc. The image tags should be entered in the form below:

```bash
export MONGO_IMAGE=[ mongo image (mongo:latest)]
export API_IMAGE=[ api image (capitalone/hygieia-api:2.0.5) ]
export UI_IMAGE=[ ui image (my.internal.registry:5000/devteam/hygieia-ui) ]
export HUB_IMAGE=[ hub image** ]
export NODE1_IMAGE=[ browser node image** ]
export NODE1_DRIVER=[ browser driver name (chrome, firefox, phantomjs, etc) ]
```
**NOTE:** The Hub image used in the development of this suite was selenium/hub:3.1.0

**NOTE:** The Node image used in the development of this suite was selenium/node-chrome:3.1.0

If you are running the Hygieia UI on an SSL enabled server, ensure that the following export is set to true. This will point the hub/node combo to use https://host:443 instead of http://host.

```bash
export SSL_UI=[ true | false ]
```

## Test Data Results

While the tests are being run, the entire project directory will be mounted to the UI Test container. Simply go to ${UI-Test Project Home}/target/site/serenity/index.html when the test execution is complete to view the test results.

## A note on test data...

Since the tests were designed to run on a docker platform, **there is no data cleanup**. The original intent was to just remove the database node once the tests were complete.

## A note on passwords...

Since this is all test data, passwords are not encrypted. The included database setup file (mongo_setup.js) has a hashed password 'password' to allow easy insertion.

## Executing Tests Without Docker Setup

In the UI-tests folder under project root, execute the following command. Use an existing username and password for the tests to login to the application

Example:

`mvn clean verify -f ./docker-pom.xml -DUITEST_EXISTING_USERNAME=hygieia_test_user -DUITEST_EXISTING_PASSWORD=password`
