### What is Hygieia℠?

##### Pronunciation:      hi-gee-ya (origin Greek)
Hygieia℠ is a single, configurable, easy-to-use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline.

Watch the video below to see Hygieia℠ in action:

We use tools for everything today, and each tool has its own unique dashboard to present information. What is lacking is a near real-time consolidated view of the end-to-end delivery pipeline. This view and a continuous feedback loop are critical to the success of any DevOps organization.

Capital One Engineers from our DevOps team developed Hygieia with the need for a user-friendly, out-of-the-box DevOps visualization tool in mind since none is available commercially. We researched existing tools and found:

* Commercial application lifecycle management tools allow users to visualize traceability between stories, code, tests, and builds; however, they do not cross over from build to deployment.

* Commercial operations tools provide visibility into server and application run time health, metrics, analytics, etc.; however, they do not provide visibility into the development and build activities.

* Open source tools/frameworks such as Grafana provide a generic framework for building dashboards; however, collecting data from numerous DevOps tools is still a challenge.

Hygieia offers a near real-time consolidated view of the end-to-end delivery pipeline, making it an excellent choice for any DevOps organization. Hygieia's features include:

* **Team Dashboard**: Monitor work items, code repositories, builds, quality items (unit tests, security, coverage, etc.), and deployments in one dashboard.

* **Real-time Status**: Monitor quality, productivity, and work in process on a real-time basis within the dashboard.

* **Configurable View**: Set up the dashboard to display the widgets that matter most to your project.

* **Open Source**: Hygieia is open source and free for everyone to use. We encourage external users to provide feedback and contribute to the project.
